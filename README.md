# CS210
The project involved creating a code that uses python to read a file and gather information from it and out put it in certain fasions. I think organizing the code went well for me. I was able to seperate definitions and call them when needed to make the code easy to read and work well. To enhance the code I could make it easier to follow with the structure of the .cpp file in my opinion. I found the definitions and setting up C++ to work with python the hardest part. It took me days to figure it out and watching videos and looking uo solutions to get it right. All of it is susable becuase it encompases the basics of codeing and problem solving that is needed to do this job.
